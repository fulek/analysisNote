\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}\label{chapter:summary}

Inclusive and identified (pion, kaon, proton and their antiparticles) charged particle production in Single Diffractive Dissociation process has been measured in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}= 200$ GeV with the STAR detector at RHIC using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 15 nb$^{-1}$.

Significant differences are observed between the~measured distributions  of $\xi$ and \ac{MC} model predictions. Amongst the models considered, EPOS and PYTHIA~8 (MBR) without artificial suppression of diffractive cross sections at large $\xi$ provide the~best description of the~data.

Charged-particle multiplicity and its dependence  on the~pseudorapidity and the~transverse momentum  are well described by PYTHIA8 and EPOS SD$^\prime$ models.  EPOS SD+SD$^\prime$ and HERWIG do not describe the data.

$\pi^-/\pi^+$ and $K^-/K^+$ production ratios  are close to unity and consistent with most of model predictions except for HERWIG. 

$\bar{p}/p$ production ratio shows a significant deviation from unity 
in the $0.02<\xi<0.05$ range indicating a~non-negligible transfer of the baryon number from the forward to the central region. Equal amount of protons and antiprotons are observed in the $\xi>0.05$ range.
PYTHIA8, EPOS SD+SD$^\prime$ and EPOS SD$^\prime$ agree with data for $\xi>0.05$. 
For $0.02<\xi<0.05$ PYTHIA~8 and EPOS SD$^\prime$ predict small deviations from unity $(0.93)$ which is however higher than observed in data ($0.85\pm 0.04)$. EPOS SD+SD$^\prime$ predicts an asymmetry between $\bar{p}$ and $p$ of $\sim30\%$ at $0.02<\xi<0.05$.
HERWIG  predicts much larger baryon number transfers compared to data for $\xi<0.1$ and shows consistency with data for $\xi>0.1$.
