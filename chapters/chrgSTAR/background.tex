\chapter{Background Contribution}\label{section:star_background}
The background contributions to the charged-particle distributions can be divided into
event-level and track-level backgrounds, and are described in detail below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Accidental background refers to events which do not originate from a single collision of two protons.
	%\item Non-SD background comprise contibution of non-SD events which originate from a single $pp$ collision.
	\item Track backgrounds from non-primary tracks consist of secondary tracks and fake tracks; the first come mostly from decays, the short-lived particles with mean life $30 < \tau < 300$~ps, or secondary interactions with the detector dead material, while the second comes from the track reconstruction algorithms and out-of-time pile-up with
	no corresponding true particles.
\end{itemize}
