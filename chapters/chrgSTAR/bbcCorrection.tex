\subsection{Correction to BBC-Small }\label{section:star_bbc}
The SDT trigger conditions imposed signal in RPs and veto on any signal in the same-side small BBC tiles, whereas signal in the opposite-side BBC-small was required by the offline event selection. A common BBC-small efficiency, $\epsilon_{BBC}$, was obtained as a function of each measured quantity using  PYTHIA 8 4C (SaS) embedded into Zerobias data.

The efficiency was calculated  for events within fiducial region as follows:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{BBC}=\frac{\textrm{number of MC events satysfying the BBC-small selection criteria}}{\textrm{number of MC events}}
\end{equation}
\Cref{fig:bbcCorection_nch,fig:bbcCorection_pt,fig:bbcCorection_eta} show the fraction of generated true-level MC events, within the fiducial region of the measurement, in which the selection criteria on BBC-small signal and veto are satisfied . The $\epsilon_{BBC}$  varies from about $90\%$ for events with $\xi$ within $0.02-0.05$ to about $65\%$ for events with $0.1<\xi<0.2$.

\subsubsection{Systematic uncertainty}
When the data is corrected for BBC-small efficiency, there is an assumption that the MC used in the analysis, PYTHIA~8~4C~(SaS), provides correct correlation between the true value of $\xi$ and forward particles produced in the BBC acceptance region.  The uncertainty related to this correction is  estimated by using a HERWIG~MC sample, where the hadronisation model is different from that used in PYTHIA~8. Figure~\ref{fig:bbcCorection_syst} shows the PYTHIA~8  prediction on BBC efficiency  divided by the HERWIG prediction in three ranges of $\xi$. The deviations between these two models are of the order of $2\%$ at $0.05<\xi<0.1$ and about $10\%$ for  other two $\xi$ regions. The difference between these two hadronisation models was propagated as a systematic uncertainty.
