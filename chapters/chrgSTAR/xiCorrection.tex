\subsection[Migrations of $\xi$]{Migrations of $\mathbf{\xi}$}\label{section:star_xi}
The analysis was performed in three ranges of $\xi$. Since that, there are
migrations into and out of these $\xi$ regions. They mainly originate from the resolution of $\xi$, which is measured with the RPs. Figure~\ref{fig:xi_correction_resolution} shows the resolution of measured $\xi$ (denoted as $\xi_{reco}$) as a function of the true-level $\xi$ (denoted as $\xi_{true}$) with fitted zeroth order polynomial. The resolution of $\xi_{reco}$ is fairly constant and equals to about $0.4\%$.

The corrections due to migrations into and out of  $\xi$ regions was defined as:
 \begin{equation}
 f_{xi} = \frac{1-f_{xi}^-}{1-f_{xi}^+}
 \end{equation}
 where:
 \begin{description}
 	\item $f_{xi}^-$ is the fraction of events for which the corresponding true-level $\xi_{true}$, is outside of the $\xi$ region,
 	\item $f_{xi}^+$  is the fraction of events for which the corresponding reconstructed $\xi_{reco}$ is outside of the $\xi$ region.
 \end{description}
 The $f_{\xi}$ was calculated for each measured variable separately. \Cref{fig:xi_correction_nch,fig:xi_correction_pt,fig:xi_correction_eta} show the fraction of events $f_{xi}^-$ and $f_{xi}^+$ as a function of $n_{ch}$, $p_T$ and $\bar{\eta}$. The largest differences between migrations into and out of the $\xi$ regions were observed at $0.02<\xi<0.05$, where they are of the order of $2-3\%$. In the other $\xi$ regions, the difference between $f_{xi}^-$ and $f_{xi}^+$  is smaller than $1\%$.
