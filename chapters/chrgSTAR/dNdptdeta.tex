\subsection{Correction to transverse momentum and pseudorapidity distribution}\label{section:star_dNdeta_dNdpt}
First the accidental and non-SD backgrounds were subtrated from the $p_T$ and $\bar{\eta}$ distributions. Next, the tracks were  corrected for vertex reconstruction efficiency by applying $w_{ev}^{vrt}(n_{vrt}^{global},|\Delta z_0|)$ weights. Then, the tracks were corrected for the track reconstruction efficiency, non-primary track background contribution, track and $\xi$ migrations, BBC-small efficiency (the product of $w_{trk}(p_T,\eta,V_z)$, $f_\xi$ and $w_{BBC}$ weights was applied). 


The following distributions were obtained from this procedure :
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2N}{d\bar{\eta}dp_T},\textrm{\hspace{2cm}} \frac{dN}{d\bar{\eta}}
\label{eq:pteta_bar}
\end{equation}

In order to obtain the charged particle multiplicity distributions as a function of $p_T$ and $\bar{\eta}$,  distributions given by Eq.~\ref{eq:pteta_bar} were normalized to unity and scaled by the average charged particle multiplicity in an event $\langle n_{ch}\rangle$. The latter was calculated from the corrected charged particle multiplicity distribution $dN/dn_{ch}$ (Sec.~\ref{section:star_dNdnch}).

As a result, the corrected distributions of charged particle multiplicity are expressed as:
 \begin{equation}
 \frac{1}{N_{ev}}\frac{1}{2\pi p_T}\frac{d^2N}{d\bar{\eta}dp_T},\textrm{\hspace{2cm}} \frac{1}{N_{ev}}\frac{dN}{d\bar{\eta}}
 \label{eq:pt_eta_bar_full}
 \end{equation}
 
 In addition, the mean particle densities in an event, $\langle p_T\rangle$ and $\langle \bar{\eta}\rangle$, were calculated as an average of distributions given by Eq.~\ref{eq:pt_eta_bar_full}.
