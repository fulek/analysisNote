\subsection{Background from Non-Primary Tracks}\label{section:star_background_primary}
Reconstructed tracks matched to non-primary particle  originate  mainly from these sources:
\begin{itemize}
	\item decays of short-lived primary particles with strange quark content (mostly $K^0$ and $\Lambda^0$),
	\item photons from $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ decays which are converting to $e^-e^+$,
	\item hadronic interactions of particles with the beam-pipe or detector dead material.
\end{itemize} 
Figure~\ref{fig:bkg_fake_charged} shows the background $f_{bkg}\left(p_T,\eta\right)$ and fake track $f_{fake}\left(p_T,\eta\right)$ contribution to reconstructed tracks. There were no differences observed in the background contribution at different $\xi$ ranges, since that all three $\xi$ ranges were merged for this study. The highest background fraction, which varies between $5-10\%$, was found to be at low $p_T$. There is also a contribution from fake tracks (tracks not associated to true-level particle) which are out-of-time pile-up tracks or  are formed by a random combination of TPC hits. The fake track contribution was calculated in each $\xi$ range separately.
