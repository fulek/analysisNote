\section{Background from Non-Primary Tracks}\label{section:star_background_primary}
Reconstructed tracks matched to a~non-primary particle, so-called background tracks,  originate  mainly from the~following sources:
\begin{itemize}
	\item decays of short-lived primary particles with strange quark content (mostly $K^0$, $\Lambda^0$),
	\item photons from $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ decays which are converting to $e^+e^-$,
	\item hadronic interactions of particles with the beam-pipe or detector dead material.
\end{itemize}

There is also a contribution from fake tracks, i.e. tracks not associated with true-level particles, coming from out-of-time pile-up or  formed by a random combination of TPC hits. Figure~\ref{fig:bkg_fake_charged} shows the background $f_{\textrm{bkg}}\left(p_{\textrm{T}},\eta\right)$ and fake track $f_{\textrm{fake}}\left(p_{\textrm{T}},\eta\right)$ contribution to reconstructed tracks as a~function of $p_{\textrm{T}}$ and $\eta$. There were no differences observed in the~background contribution in different $\xi$ ranges, hence, all three $\xi$ ranges were merged for this study. The highest background fraction, which varies between $5-10\%$, was found to be at low $p_{\textrm{T}}$.  Due to too low statistics in PYTHIA~8 embedding \ac{MC}, the~shape of the~fake track contribution was assumed to be the~same in all three $\xi$ ranges. However, its normalization was calculated for each $\xi$ range separately with a ratio between the ranges of $1: 0.74: 1.11$.
The~change by $\pm100\%$ in fake track contribution was taken as a systematic uncertainty.


Figure~\ref{fig:bkg_epos_charged} shows the~background track contribution to reconstructed tracks as a~function of $p_\textrm{T}$ and $\eta$ calculated from EPOS SD+SD$^\prime$. The differences between
PYTHIA~8 and EPOS, which are up to $50\%$ for $p_\textrm{T}>0.5$~GeV/c (as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bkg_epos_charged_1D}), were symmetrized and taken as a~systematic uncertainty.
