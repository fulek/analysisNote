\section{Reconstructed Track Notions}\label{section:star_track_labels}
STAR uses the notions of global and primary tracks. When the event is recorder, the reconstruction algorithm fits a set of TPC hits  with helices, which results in a collection of \textit{global tracks}. Next, all the reconstructed global tracks are extrapolated to the $z$-axis. Tracks that point towards the same vertex are grouped by a minimalization technique and then refitted to include the primary vertex. The resulting tracks are referred to as \textit{primary tracks}, whose momentum resolution is much better in comparison to global tracks.
