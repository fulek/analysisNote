\section{Reconstruction}\label{sec:reconstruction}
Raw data was processed with the library version SL17f with the following BFC options:

\vspace{1em}

The \texttt{UseBTOFmatchOnly} option was used to form the vertices only from the global TPC tracks matched with TOF hits. It was found that this option provides better signal reconstruction efficiency and resolutions. 

The produced MuDst files (standard STAR data format) were further reduced to Cracow's picoDst data format.
