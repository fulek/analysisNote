\section{Online Selection}\label{section:star_trigger_selection}

The first stage of event selection was at online level. The SDT trigger was formed by the following conditions combined with the logical AND:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item RP\_EOR $||$ RP\_WOR - signal in at least one RP on one side of the STAR central detector.
	\item Veto on any signal in small BBC tiles or ZDC on the triggered RP  side of the~STAR central detector.
	\item At least two TOF hits.
\end{enumerate}


Above requirements were imposed in accordance with the diffractive events topology. Veto on any signal in small BBC tiles and ZDC allows to accept only events with rapidity gap and reject diffractive events with parallel pile-up event. The requirement of at least two TOF hits was to ensure activity in the mid-rapidity.
