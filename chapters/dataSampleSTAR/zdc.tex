\subsubsection{ZDC Veto}\label{section:star_zdc_selection}
The~SDT trigger conditions imposed a veto on any signal in the~same-side ZDC. However, all MC samples do not contain ZDC simulation. To check the impact of this veto on the measurement, the total energy of neutral particles, such as $n$, $\gamma$, $\pi^{0}$, produced within ZDC acceptance ($|\eta|>6$) was measured using true-level PYTHIA~8~(SaS). In most of the events, the~energy measured on the proton side of the~IP is smaller than trigger thresholds (as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:zdcSTAR}). Therefore, the~ZDC veto has a~negligible effect on the~analysis and ZDC simulation is not needed.
