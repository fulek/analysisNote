\section{Particle Identification by $dE/dx$}\label{sec:pid}
The specific ionization energy loss, the $dE/dx$, is a function of the
particle momentum magnitude. This property is used
for particle identification. This analysis focuses on particle
identification in the low $p_T$ region. This section describes
the low $p_T$ $dE/dx$ particle identification method in detail.
Extension of particle identification to high $p_T$ is possible
by the Time of Flight (TOF), $t^{TOF}=t^{stop}-t^{start}$ . Due to the low particle multiplicity and lack of signal in VPDs on the outgoing proton side (rapidity gap) in SD events, the $t^{start}$ is not defined precisely. Since that, the analysis was limited to identification only by $dE/dx$. \newline
The ionization energy loss by charged particles in material
is given by the Bethe-Bloch formula and for
thin material by the more precise Bichsel formula\cite{Bichsel:2006cs}.At
low momentum, ionization energy loss is approximately
inversely proportional to the particle velocity squared.
With the measured particle momentum and $dE/dx$,
the particle type can be determined by comparing the
measurements against the Bethe-Bloch (Bichsel) expectation. Figure \ref{fig:dedx} shows the measured $dE/dx$ versus rigidity $q\times p$ for particles in $|\eta| < 0.7$. Various bands, corresponding
to different mass particles, are clearly separated
at low $|q\times p|$. At modest $|q\times p|$, the bands start to
overlap: $e^\pm$ and $K^\pm$ merge at $\sim0.5$~GeV/c, $K^\pm$ and
$\pi^\pm$ merge at $\sim0.7$~GeV/c, and $p(\bar{p})$ and $\pi^\pm$ merge
at $\sim1.2$~GeV/c. However, particles can still be statistically
identified by a fitting procedure to deconvolute the
overlapped distribution into several components. The
separation of the $dE/dx$ bands depends on the pseudorapidity
region and decreases toward higher rapidities.
To obtain maximal separation we only concentrate on
the mid-rapidity region of $|\eta| < 0.7$. Additionally, in this narrow pseudorapidity slice, $p_T$ is approximately equal to $|p|$.

\noindent Since the $dE/dx$ distribution for a fixed particle type
is not Gaussian, a new variable is useful in order
to have a proper deconvolution into Gaussians. A better Gaussian variable, for a given
particle type, is the $n\sigma^i_{dE/dx}$-variable, defined as
\begin{equation}
n\sigma^i_{dE/dx}=\ln\left(\frac{dE/dx}{(dE/dx)_i^{BB}}\right)/\sigma
\end{equation}
where $(dE/dx)_i^{BB}$ is the Bethe-Bloch (Bichsel) expectation
of $dE/dx$ for the given particle type $i (i =
\pi, K, p)$, $\sigma$ - the $dE/dx$ resolution.
The expected value of $n\sigma^i_{dE/dx}$ for the particle in study is around $0$. The $n\sigma^i_{dE/dx}$ is shown for $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^\pm$ and $p(\bar{p})$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:nsigma}, where the band of $i$-particle is situated around 0.

\noindent The $n\sigma^i_{dE/dx}$ distribution is constructed for a given particle
type in a given $p_T$ bin within $|\eta| < 0.7$. Figure \ref{fig:nsigmafit}
shows the $n\sigma^{\pi^\pm}_{dE/dx}$,$n\sigma^{K^\pm}_{dE/dx}$ and $n\sigma^{p(\bar{p})}_{dE/dx}$ distributions for one $p_T$ bin, each corrected for the energy loss\cite{commonnote} (mass of $i$-particle was taken) and vertexing. The distributions show a multi-Gaussian structure. To extract the raw particle yield for a given particle type,
a multi-Gaussian fit is applied to the $n\sigma^i_{dE/dx}$ distribution as
superimposed in Fig.~\ref{fig:nsigmafit}. The parameters of the multi-Gaussian fit are the centroids $\mu_{i^-/i^+}$, widths $\sigma_{i^-/i^+}$, sum  and ratios  of amplitudes $C_{i^-/i^+}$, $r_{i^-/i^+}$ for negative $i^-$ and positive $i^+$ particles ($\pi^\pm$, $e^\pm$, $K^\pm$, $p$ and $\bar{p}$). The positive and negative particle
$n\sigma^{i}_{dE/dx}$-distributions are fit simultaneously. The particle
and antiparticle centroids and widths are kept the same
